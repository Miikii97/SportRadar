How I Used AI During This Assignment

During the development of this project, I used AI (ChatGPT) as a support tool — not to produce the entire solution, but to help me clarify concepts, 
solve specific issues, and speed up repetitive tasks. Below is a transparent explanation of what parts I wrote myself and what parts were influenced by AI.

/// What I Wrote Myself ///

I personally wrote the following main parts of the project:

The HTML structure for index.html, including the layout of the calendar, carousel, match table, form, and news section.

The logic for the details page (details.html + details.js).

The full match dataset (matches.js) including structure, properties, and sample data.

The integration logic for:

Clicking an event in the calendar to open the details page

Extracting query parameters and showing match information

Populating the match table

The majority of the CSS styling for:
---Navbar
---Footer
---Details layout

I also made the final decisions on how the UI should behave and how data should be stored.

// Calendar Integration //

Understand how to convert my match objects into FullCalendar event objects

Configure eventClick to redirect to the details page

Hide the full event title and display a small dot instead

However, I wrote the final logic and made sure I understood every parameter (title, start, extendedProps, etc.).


/// What Was Influenced by AI ///

AI helped me mainly with implementation ideas, bug fixing, and code optimization. These include:

LocalStorage Saving Logic:

---The AI helped me design the idea of:
---Loading matches from localStorage first
---Merging or replacing matches
---Updating the calendar when new matches are added

Modal Form Logic:

---I used AI to generate a starting version of the modal form submission handler.
I then:

---Adapted it to my match object structure
---Fixed index tracking
---Connected it to FullCalendar


/// To avoid blindly copying code, I followed these steps: ///

---I manually tested every feature after adding AI-suggested code.
---I rewrote several parts that were too abstract or didn’t match my project structure.
---I added console logs and inspected event objects to make sure I understood exactly what was happening.
---I checked the FullCalendar documentation to confirm any properties suggested by AI.
---I adjusted variable names, object shapes, and formatting to maintain consistency with my own code.
This process ensured I fully understood, verified, and controlled all AI-assisted contributions.


/// Important Technical Decisions I Made ///

Using FullCalendar instead of building my own calendar from scratch
→ It allowed me to focus on match logic rather than calendar implementation.

Storing matches in localStorage
→ Ensures user-added matches persist without requiring a backend.

Using URL parameters to display match details
→ Simple, clean, and efficient for a multi-page static site.


/// One Improvement I Would Make With More Time ///

If I had more time, I would implement:
---Editable and deletable user-created matches
---Right now, users can add matches but cannot update or remove them.
---Adding CRUD functionality would make the calendar truly dynamic and more professional.


/// Summary ///

AI was used ethically and responsibly as a learning tool — not as a replacement for my own coding.
I understand all the code in this project and made all final architectural and technical decisions myself.
